# Cyborg System Monitor

## June 2nd 2021 concept

Cyborg System Monitor is a system monitor modification for Linux (process/task) (managers/monitors) that combines human analogy with computer analogy in terms of human health. 

This was inspired by a nutritionist appointment today, where I learned about health factors in better detail, and also by my experiments with the merging of human and computer analogy.
